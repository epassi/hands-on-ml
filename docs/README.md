These are my exercise files for Chapter 2 of [Hands on Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XGF2G87/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_7UcKEbAW97B0X) by Aurélien Géron. 

It started as a notebook for following my first end-to-end machine learning project. At the end of the chapter, I wanted to see if I could build an app around the ML model.

I'm using Flask to create the API around the ML model, and Vue.js to make the front-end.
